If you have a custom mod on your fork then please add the name here and the link to Curse or its original URL.
You don't have to do this if you know how to add mods to the manifest.json file!
The correct way of formatting this is:

MOD (INCLUDE CURSE ID IF ITS A CURSE MOD!) : URL : IS IT OK TO USE ON MODPACK? : IS IT ON CURSE?
